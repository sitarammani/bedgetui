# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS - Windows Version

Follow these steps **on a Windows computer** to build the Windows .exe file.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** installed (from https://www.python.org)
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **This file:** `build_windows.bat` (the build script)

## Build Steps

1. **Copy all these files to a Windows folder:**
   - `generate_reports_email.py`
   - `category_map.csv`
   - `build-requirements.txt`
   - `spending_report.spec`
   - `build_windows.bat`

2. **On Windows, open Command Prompt in that folder:**
   ```
   Right-click in the folder → "Open Command Prompt here"
   ```

3. **Run the build script:**
   ```
   build_windows.bat
   ```

   The script will:
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install all dependencies
   - Build the executable
   - Create the dist folder

4. **Wait for completion** (~5-10 minutes)

   You'll see: `✓ Build Complete!`

## Result

After completion, you'll have:

```
dist\Spending_Report_Generator\Spending_Report_Generator.exe
```

The executable is ready to share with Windows users!

## Troubleshooting

**"Python not found"**
- Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH
- Restart Command Prompt and try again

**"Build failed"**
- Delete `build_env` folder
- Run `build_windows.bat` again

**"Permission denied"**
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Try building again

## Questions?

The executable will be ~57-60 MB and requires no Python installation to run.
